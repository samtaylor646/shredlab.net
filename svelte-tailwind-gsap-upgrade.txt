Summary Prompt: SvelteKit Project Setup for Shredlab.net
This prompt summarizes the discussion for adopting SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/svelte, and GSAP to modernize shredlab.net/v6, focusing on efficiency, clean B/W aesthetics, and advanced animations.


Project Goals:
Modernize and improve efficiency of http://shredlab.net/v6 and linked pages, including calculator.html.
Maintain existing clean, black-and-white aesthetic.
Implement advanced page load transitions and animations using GSAP.
Create a new admin section for managing quotes.

Recommended Technology Stack:
Framework: SvelteKit (handles routing, server rendering, file-based pages)
Styling: Tailwind CSS (utility-first approach to maintain B/W control)
Design System/UI Library: shadcn/svelte (highly customizable, headless components built with Tailwind CSS)
Animation: GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform for complex transitions)

Key Decisions & Rationale:
Svelte vs. Vue/Blazor: Svelte was chosen for its superior performance (compiler-based, no virtual DOM), smaller bundle sizes, and concise syntax, which aligns with the goal of a fast and clean site.
Design System: A combination of Tailwind CSS and shadcn/svelte was chosen because they offer full control over styling. shadcn/svelte's "copy and paste" method allows complete ownership of the component code, ensuring the B/W style is preserved without fighting a library's default themes.
Animation: GSAP is retained as it is framework-agnostic and provides industry-leading control and performance for advanced animations, complementing Svelte's efficiency.

Implementation Plan (Step-by-Step):
Set up SvelteKit Project: Use npm create svelte@latest and configure TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier.
Install Tailwind CSS: Use npx svelte-add tailwindcss.
Initialize shadcn/svelte: Use npx shadcn-svelte@latest init to add UI components built with Tailwind CSS (select "Slate" as a base color, but customize with B/W classes).
Install GSAP: Use npm install gsap.


Migrate Calculator:
Create src/routes/calculator/+page.svelte.
Copy existing HTML, CSS, and JS into the Svelte file.
Wrap DOM-dependent JS in Svelte's onMount lifecycle function.

Create Admin Page:
Create src/routes/admin/quotes/+page.svelte.
Use the shadcn/svelte CLI (npx shadcn-svelte@latest add input label button card form) to quickly build a form and interface for managing quotes, using B/W Tailwind styling.


Implement Animations: Use GSAP within Svelte components' onMount function or SvelteKit's layout files (+layout.svelte) to manage advanced page transitions and effects.

Outcome:
A modern, highly performant website that maintains a clean B/W aesthetic while incorporating advanced, smooth animations and an efficient, maintainable codebase.
